## [1.1.0] - Unreleased

Checks and tests only. The tool's output is unchanged.

### Added

- A test that runs `dashboard.py` end to end on the sample data and checks the README's Result block against what it actually prints, so the README can't drift from the code.
- A check that the committed `assets/report.md` is exactly what the script regenerates.
- Regression tests for the code-review fixes already in 1.0.0: sign-first negative amounts, the forecast finish rounded to the nearest day, milestones with a missing date flagged rather than called Delayed, and markdown-safe free text.
- A test that pins the chart colors and styling shared across all six toolkit repos.
- ruff linting, run locally from `ruff.toml` and as its own CI job.
- CI now tests on Python 3.11 and 3.12, matching the "Python 3.11+" badge.
- `.gitattributes` keeps line endings consistent (LF) on every OS.

### Changed

- Import formatting in the tests, from the new lint rules. No behaviour change.
