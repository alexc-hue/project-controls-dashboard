"""Standardized chart color system and chrome, shared across the toolkit.

CHART_BG/INK/GRID/SERIES_1 and apply_chrome() stay byte-for-byte identical
across all six github.com/alexc-hue project-controls repos (schedule-health-
analyzer, project-controls-dashboard, change-control-register,
risk-trend-tracker, project-controls-reporting-engine,
recovery-scenario-planner); each repo adds only the extra constants its own
charts use (SERIES_2/3, STATUS_*, BASELINE), so files diverge beyond that
shared core by design. Each repo carries its own copy so it stays
independently cloneable and runnable on its own. This repo is the canonical
source for the shared core -- update it here first, then re-sync the rest.
