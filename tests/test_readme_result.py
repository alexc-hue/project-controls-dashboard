"""The README's Result block has to match what the script actually prints.

Runs the real entry script (dashboard.py) end to end against the sample data
in data/, with charts and report files redirected to a temp directory so
assets/ is left alone. Every line of the fenced block under "## Result" in
README.md must then appear, in order and unbroken, in the captured output.
Change the code so the numbers move, and this fails until the README is
updated to match.
